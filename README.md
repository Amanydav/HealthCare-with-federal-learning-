# HealthCare-with-federal-learning-

Federated Learning solves this by training models locally on each hospital’s or institution’s data and aggregating model updates instead of raw data.

This project implements and compares several FL algorithms:

FedAvg (Baseline)

FedProx

FedAdam

FedAdagrad

The goal is to identify which method gives the best accuracy and convergence for healthcare applications like diabetes or heart disease prediction.
